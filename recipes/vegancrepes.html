    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tasty vegan crêpes! This is the first recipe for crêpes that I have ever been able to make right. I was psyched that I didn't have to use egg replacer. For a twist, replace the maple syrup with hazelnut syrup, or any other flavor you like.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup soy milk</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>¼ cup melted soy margarine</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon turbinado sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix flour, soy milk, water, 1/4 cup soy margarine, maple syrup, sugar, and salt together in a large mixing bowl until combined; cover and chill for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Lightly grease a 6-inch skillet with some soy margarine. Heat the skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Pour 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter into the skillet and immediately rotate the skillet to spread batter out in a thin layer. Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
    </ol>
